# Footfall-Insight-Dashboard
Power BI dashboard analyzing retail footfall trends. The dashboard presents actionable insights on visitor trends by hour, day, month and site name to support data-driven decision-making. 
# Key Insights and Features:-
Total footfall Metrics:  Overview of key KPIs including Total Count, Average Footfall, and Location-wise performance. 

Custom DAX Measures:  Built with DAX formulas to calculate dynamic totals, averages, and min, max Hourly footfall and weekday footfall. 

Comprehensive Footfall Overview: Displays over 2 million total footfalls, with clear segmentation of Northbound (892K) and Southbound (970K) traffic. These metrics provide a baseline for understanding overall site engagement. 

Hourly Average Footfall by Location: Shows Davygate as the most active location with a 2.4K average hourly footfall, followed by Blake Street and Goodramgate. This supports location-specific strategy planning. 

Weekdays Footfall: A pie chart reveals that Saturday and Sunday are the busiest days, each contributing 18.52% of total footfall. This insight helps businesses plan for increased staffing or promotional activities during weekends.

Interactive Filtering: Includes a weekday slicer, allowing users to filter and interact with visuals dynamically for more granular analysis.
